P{
This tab looks at the 8 direction surrounding a cell and displays what
the vision related KFORTH instructions will return.

}

P{
The cell is shown in the middle of the dialog. Surrounding the cell are the results
from looking along each of the 8 directions. Shown is the distance (the WHERE value) and
the type of thing seen (WHAT value).
}

P{
The instructions B{LOOK}, B{WHAT}, B{WHERE}, B{NEAREST},
B{NEAREST2}, B{FARTHEST}, and B{FARTHEST2}.
will be using the same information as is displayed in this dialog. This dialog
will help in debugging organisms.
}

P{
SubSection{LOOK Examples}
Here's some KFORTH instructions and what they will return, assuming the data shown above.
}

CodeSample<<_EOF_

      1 NEAREST		; returns (1, 0)

_EOF_

P{
The mask is '1' meaning find the nearest CELL. Which would be direction (1, 0). There
are six cells visible to this cell, and the one at (1, 0) has the smallest distance: 3.
}

CodeSample<<_EOF_

      3 NEAREST		; returns (1, 0)

_EOF_

P{
The mask is '3' meaning find the nearest CELL or SPORE. Which would be direction (1, 0) as the
distance 11 is the smallest containing a SPORE.
}

CodeSample<<_EOF_

      8 FARTHEST	; returns (-1, 0)

_EOF_

P{
The mask is '8' meaning find the farthest BARRIER. Which would be direction (1, 1) as the
distance 43 is the largest distance. This is a "tie" condition; FARTHEST/NEAREST look
at each direction in clock-wise order beginning with a RANDOM direction. So the result
may differ.
}

CodeSample<<_EOF_

      15 NEAREST		; returns (1, 0)

_EOF_

P{
The NEAREST and FARTHEST instructions take a mask, so OR'ing 1, 2, 4, and 8 is "everything". The OR'ing
of all what-values is 15. This instruction therefore will return the direction to nearest CELL, SPORE,
ORGANIC, or BARRIER. The result is direction (1, 0) because 3 is the smallest distance.
}

CodeSample<<_EOF_

      15 FARTHEST		; returns (0, -1)

_EOF_

P{
Here we get (0, -1). Looing along direction (0, -1) we see something at a distance of 49. This is the largest
distance

HRULE{}

P{
SubSection{SIZE, BIGGEST and SMALLEST Examples}
The SIZE of the organism is the number of cells it consists of.
}

HRULE{}

P{
SubSection{HOTTEST, COLDEST and TEMPERATURE Examples}
The TEMPERATURE of the organism is how much energy it has. The HOTTEST thing is the thing
with the most energy. The COLDEST thing is the thing with the least energy.
